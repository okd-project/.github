Community Support for OKD 4
===
There is no official product support for OKD as it is a community project. All assistance is provided by volunteers from the user community.

# How to ask for help

For questions or feedback, start a discussion on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/discussions) or reach us on [Kubernetes Slack on #openshift-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C6AD6JM17).
If you are not a member of the Kubernetes Slack workspace, you can request your invitation on [slack.kubernetes.io](https://slack.kubernetes.io).

# Community Etiquette

As all assistance is provided by the community, you are reminded of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when asking a question or replying to a question.

Before starting a new discussion topic, do a search on the discussion forum to see if anyone else has already raised the same issue - then contribute to the existing discussion topic rather than starting a new topic.

When seeking help you should provide all the information a community volunteer may need to assist you.  The easier it is for a volunteer to understand your issue, the more likely they are to provide assistance.

This information should include:

- the version of OKD you are using
- the platform you are running on (and type of install - IPI / UPI)
- if you are following instructions and are having issues, a link to the instructions
- the [must gather logs](https://docs.okd.io/latest/support/gathering-cluster-data.html) - these should be uploaded to a sharing site, such as [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/) then a public link added to the discussion topic
- a description of the steps that can be used to recreate your issue, if applicable

Please do not tag people you see answering other questions to try to get a faster answer as it is anti-social.  We have an active community and it is up to individuals which questions they feel they want to respond to.

# Raising bugs

We are trying to do all the diagnostic work in the discussion forum rather than using issues for the OKD project.  If you are certain you have discovered a bug, then please raise an [issue](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/issues), but if you are not sure if you have found a bug then use the discussion forum to discuss it.  If it turns out to be a bug, then the discussion topic can be converted to an issue.

# Enterprise Support
OKD is an upstream distribution of [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift). We use the same underlying technology and components. If you require indepth and continuing support for your operation consider switching to OpenShift with a [Red Hat subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/value-of-Red-Hat).
