Hello, welcome to OKD
===
OKD is a community distribution of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (K8s), a collection of software and design patterns to operate applications at scale.

We're the upstream community to [RedHat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) and use broadly the same underlying technologies and components.

# Getting Started
To get started with OKD and get a cluster online on your laptop or lab environment please go to our [website](https://www.okd.io/).

# Say Hello
We have a community of users and contributors. There is an active community on the [K8s Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) in [#openshift-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C6AD6JM17) and we also have a mailing list and social media presence. Our [Community Page](https://www.okd.io/community/) has more information.

# Get Involved
OKD is goverened by a Working Group and we are always looking for volunteers and contributors to get involved. Please see our [Contributing page](https://www.okd.io/contributor/) and we hope to see you at a meeting or on our issue trackers soon!
